# Develop a Dashboard for Analytics with React

# SportSee

This repository contains the code for the SportSee dashboard user profile page.

## 1. How to install the application

## 1.1 Prerequisites

#### 1.1.A Tools

- [Node.js (version 16.15.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm (version 8.11.0)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [yarn (to install and run the API)](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### 1.1.B API

I recommend that you create a folder on your computer that will contain the back and front code:

```
- sportsee
    - back
    - front
```

> Note: it says that the API requires a certain version of NodeJS, be aware that you can use a different version for the user interface without causing a problem of compatibility with the API.

### 1.2 Launch the project

- Clone it on your computer,
- The command `npm install` will allow you to install the project dependencies,
- The command `npm run start` will allow you to run the user interface.

> Note: in the command interface, when running the `npm run start` command you will have to agree to change the port because the API already uses port 3000.
